A near field messaging android application for L2G9

Brief:

Proximity-sensitive messenger

You have been asked to design the interface to an interactive system that allows people to wirelessly send messages (as text), photographs, video and audio to one another. These messages will be sent over a location-sensitive mobile device to other people who are within a 100-metre radius of the sender, and who are also using this system. The system will allow users to:

send and receive messages
enter text
take or add photographs, video or audio
archive and search previous messages
know which other users/devices are within range
set up an alert when a named individual enters the device's range
navigate through the various interface components
invite new contacts, accept invitations and remove contacts

Questions and options:

Options may include changing the signal radius, or adapting it to different distances for different contacts. You may or may not choose to do this over a smartphone, and could, for example, use a dedicated device, or interactive jewellery.
